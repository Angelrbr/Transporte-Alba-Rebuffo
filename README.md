### (Whenever content is added to the site, a new version will be announced)


This Site and its subpages, were created to be used as a reference to my fictitious Cargo Deliver company based in the game Euro Truck Simulator 2.

## Version 1
The page only contains HTML and CSS files. Next versions will include animations and the integration of Bootstrap for a better visual experience.

## Version 2
The page now contains styles made with Bootstrap.

## Version 3
Sass added to the project (just a bit).
Added Meta Description for better SEO.

## Version 3.1
Some images were compressed to lower the site's overall size, improving performace.
